## üíÖüèΩ Linting

> The ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are
> constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ‚Ä¶making
> it
> easy to read makes it easier to write.

_Robert C. Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob)_

### Java

The Java files are linted using the `checkstyle` tool. The configuration file is
located in the `checkstyle.xml` file.
Run the following command to lint the Java files:

```bash
# To check the code
./gradlew clean build spotlessCheck
# To fix the code
./gradlew clean build spotlessApply
```

### Linting Gherkin files

The Gherkin files are linted using the NodeJS `gherkin-lint` tool. The
configuration
file is located in the `.gherkin-lintrc` file, and helps you find duplicated
test names that can cause problems in the reports.
Run the following command to lint the Gherkin files:

```bash
sh gherkin_check.sh
```
